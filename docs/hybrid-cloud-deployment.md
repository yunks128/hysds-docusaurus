# Hybrid Cloud and On-Premise Deployment

## Deployment Strategies

HySDS supports hybrid deployments that span across AWS and NASA HECC, allowing seamless scaling across environments while using the same Processing Control Management (PCM) infrastructure.

### Key Deployment Options:

1. **AWS Auto-scaling Spot Fleet** for rapid scaling.
2. **On-premise workers** for cost-effective compute.
3. **NASA HECC integration** with PBS nodes for large-scale high-performance computing.

The system architecture ensures jobs are handled efficiently across both cloud and on-premise resources.
