# What is HySDS?

The Hybrid Cloud Science Data System (HySDS) is an open-source science data processing framework designed to manage large-scale geospatial data processing and analysis across hybrid cloud environments. HySDS is extensively used across a variety of Earth Science missions, providing an adaptable and scalable solution for data production and management. By leveraging cloud services like AWS and high-end on-premise computing platforms like NASAâ€™s HECC, HySDS ensures robust processing capabilities for projects of all scales.

## Key Features of HySDS:
- **Hybrid-Cloud Operations**: HySDS runs seamlessly across both cloud platforms and on-premise infrastructures, enabling multi-cloud data processing.
- **Scalability**: Supports thousands of parallel computing nodes, dynamically scaling resources to meet the demands of large-scale geospatial data processing tasks.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implements fault tolerance through the use of cloud-based spot instances, allowing for cost-effective yet reliable operations.

## GitHub Repository and Community Contributions:
HySDS is actively maintained by a community of developers and contributors. The source code and documentation can be accessed through the following GitHub repository:

- **HySDS GitHub**: [https://github.com/hysds](https://github.com/hysds)

The HySDS ecosystem thrives through community-driven contributions, with over **50 developers** involved in the development and maintenance of the core framework. The community's efforts are coordinated through active Slack channels, public GitHub repositories, Jira, and Confluence wikis.

### Contributions:
- **Developers**: 50+ developers contributing to the HySDS framework.
- **Projects**: HySDS supports over **13 active projects** as of 2024, with contributions from more than **30 active collaborators**.
- **Repositories**: The GitHub organization contains **78 repositories**, reflecting the growth and evolution of HySDS through different missions and data systems.

## Notable Projects Using HySDS:
HySDS has been instrumental in several NASA missions and projects, including:
- **NISAR SDS**: Supporting the massive data production requirements for NISAR with peaks of over 300TB/day.
- **SWOT**: Enabling the reprocessing of over 2PB of data in its first year.
- **OPERA**: Operations since March 2023, showcasing the ability to span cloud and HECC platforms.
- **ASTER Volcano Archive (AVA)**: Providing on-demand and continuous data processing capabilities for volcanic monitoring.
- **PO.DAAC SWODLR**: Supporting data processing for oceanographic missions.

These projects leverage the full capabilities of HySDS, using its scalable architecture and community-driven enhancements to meet the unique challenges of Earth science data processing.

## Conclusion
HySDS is a vital tool in the modern Earth science data processing landscape, providing a scalable, fault-tolerant, and flexible solution for hybrid-cloud deployments. The open-source nature of HySDS, combined with a strong community of contributors, ensures its continued evolution and adoption across many NASA missions and research projects.
