# What is HySDS?

HySDS (Hybrid Science Data System) is an open-source science data processing system designed to handle large-scale, multi-mission science data processing tasks. It is widely used across various Earth Science missions, supporting hybrid-cloud, on-premise, and NASA HECC (High-End Computing Capabilities) environments.

**Key Features**:
- Scalable science data processing.
- Hybrid cloud architecture across AWS, NASA HECC, and on-premise systems.
- Real-time job management and faceted search.
- Open-source contributions from the community.
