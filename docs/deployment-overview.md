# Hybrid Cloud Deployment Strategies

In this section, we explore hybrid cloud and HECC (High-End Computing Capability) deployment strategies for science data processing systems, particularly through the HySDS (Hybrid Cloud Science Data System). These strategies enable scalable, fault-tolerant, and multi-cloud operations that span NASA’s cloud services like AWS and on-premise HECC resources. The architecture integrates different processing components such as the Processing Control and Data Management (PCM), Geospatial Region Query (GRQ), and Verdi compute nodes.

## 1. **Overview of Hybrid Cloud and HECC**

The hybrid cloud strategy for HySDS integrates resources from AWS, NASA HECC, and on-premise systems. These systems are orchestrated to provide scalable compute solutions capable of supporting various earth science missions. HySDS demonstrates flexibility by running workloads across different cloud environments, using AWS for scalable cloud computing and NASA's HECC for high-end processing.

### Key Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Systems can dynamically adjust to workloads across multiple platforms, such as AWS and HECC, allowing for the processing of large-scale geospatial data.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Designed to handle interruptions and fluctuations in available resources, particularly leveraging AWS spot instances to reduce costs while maintaining reliability.
- **Multi-Cloud Operations**: HySDS is capable of running across different cloud platforms, enabling redundancy and efficient data processing.

## 2. **HECC Integration and Use Cases**

NASA's HECC is a key component of the hybrid deployment, offering high-end computational power that complements AWS's cloud services. This is particularly useful for data-heavy operations that require strict cybersecurity measures and specialized configurations.

### Challenges with HECC:
- **Cybersecurity Restrictions**: HECC systems are more tightly controlled, limiting outbound data connections and introducing additional complexity for hybrid deployments.
- **Data Egress**: Moving data between AWS and HECC can incur high costs, particularly with AWS S3. Strategies such as local caching on HECC are employed to mitigate these expenses.

## 3. **PCM in Hybrid Deployments**

The Processing Control and Management (PCM) system is the backbone of the hybrid deployment architecture. PCM orchestrates the jobs between the cloud and on-premise systems, coordinating compute resources like Verdi workers on HECC and AWS.

### Deployment Options:
- **Option 1: Single PCM Across AWS and HECC**: PCM manages Verdi workers spanning both AWS and HECC. This unified approach allows for seamless job distribution across platforms, leveraging AWS’s cloud flexibility and HECC's computational power.
- **Option 2: Separate PCMs for AWS and HECC**: In some cases, distinct PCM systems are used for AWS and HECC. This enables more specialized workflows but requires managing separate systems.

## 4. **Auto-Scaling and Job Management**

A key aspect of the hybrid cloud deployment is its auto-scaling capabilities. Auto-scaling groups (ASGs) dynamically manage the compute resources, spinning up additional instances based on job queues in Mozart (job management). Auto-scaling ensures that compute resources scale efficiently with the workload, reducing costs and optimizing performance.

### Auto-Scaling Workflow:
- **Job Submission**: Jobs are submitted to the PCM, which places them in the appropriate queue.
- **Resource Scaling**: ASGs monitor queue size and adjust the number of compute nodes accordingly, either on AWS or HECC.
- **Scaling Strategy**: Each queue-ASG pair represents a specific job type, enabling targeted scaling based on job needs.

## 5. **Multi-Cloud Operations and Interoperability**

HySDS enables interoperability between AWS and HECC through standardized interfaces such as the OGC Application Package and CWL (Common Workflow Language). These allow for algorithm execution across both cloud and on-premise resources without manual intervention.

### Challenges in Multi-Cloud Operations:
- **Cross-Platform Communication**: Secure communication between AWS and HECC requires specialized networking setups, including VPNs and firewalls.
- **Interoperability Standards**: Different platforms require adherence to standards like OGC to ensure that algorithms and workflows can run across both AWS and HECC seamlessly.

## Conclusion

The hybrid cloud deployment strategy in HySDS leverages the strengths of both AWS and HECC to provide scalable, fault-tolerant, and
